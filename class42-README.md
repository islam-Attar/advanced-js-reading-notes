## ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good.
The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.

The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors,
students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur.
The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.
Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist computing professionals in understanding and applying the principle.

Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather than blind reliance on detailed regulations.
These Principles should influence software engineers to consider broadly who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues are treating other
human beings with due respect; to consider how the public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be
affected by their decisions; and to consider whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer.
In all these judgments concern for the health, safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the “Public Interest” is central to this Code.
