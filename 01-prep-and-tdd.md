Testing is the process of ensuring a program receives the correct input and generates the correct output and intended side-effects and we defind them with **specifications**

Testing is verifying our application does what it should.
There are two types of tests: manual and automated
Unit testing in general, itâ€™s a relatively small piece of application functionality.
Tests assert that your program will behave a certain way. Then the test itself proves or disproves that assertion.
